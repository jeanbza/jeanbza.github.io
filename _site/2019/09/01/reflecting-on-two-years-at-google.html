    <p>I had meant to write a <em>“Reflecting on one year at Google”</em> post earlier this
year, but it kept getting put off until suddenly I realized that it would be
better to just cut my losses and skip to the second year post.</p>

<p>Then, when I got into it, I realized that a lot of my experience with Google
was from the outside: failing repeatedly trying to get in. So, after writing a
bunch about that, I decided to create two posts: <em><a href="/2019/09/01/reflecting-on-interviewing-at-google">“Reflecting on interviewing
at Google”</a></em> and this post.</p>

<p>Now, with all that out the way, I’m finally read to really dig in and start some
serious reflection and introspection.</p>

<p>Background note: I started at Google in late 2017. I moved from Colorado to
California (San Francisco bay area) for the job, and moved back to Colorado
in early 2018 (keeping the job, but working from Boulder, Colorado).</p>

<h1 id="small-steps">
<a class="anchor" href="#small-steps" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Small steps</h1>

<p>Starting at Google was unlike any other job. Most jobs I’ve had, and heard
about, followed a pattern of a 2-week break-in period followed by a few
months contributing but still kind-of trying to get caught up, followed by
proficiency, and at some point later you might lead a team.</p>

<p>Google was very much not like that. You start by attending at 2 week
orientation with the other ~400-700 people in your “Noogler” class. Yes,
<em>hundreds</em> of people - mostly engineers - start at Google every two weeks.
On one campus. More on other campuses. Mind blown.</p>

<p>The first two weeks are spent in lectures and seminars repeatedly having your
sense of scale and proportion obliterated, being exposed to various systems and teams
within the company, being taught by senior engineers how to use some of these
systems, and generally being taught how to teach yourself.</p>

<p>In your third week you’re ready to meet your team. Your team introduces you to
a “starter project”: a small project in a well-understood area that you can use
to feel good about yourself, and hopefully along the way learn how to actually
start writing and releasing code. You’re given something like a month to finish
this.</p>

<p>So, it takes <em>6 weeks after you start</em> before you’re actually ready to look at
real code. And, beyond that, most teams will only expect you to be a
fully independent, contributing team member somewhere around month 6 to 9.</p>

<h1 id="inch-by-inch">
<a class="anchor" href="#inch-by-inch" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inch by inch</h1>

<p>My first actually-useful piece of code I submitted, if I recall correctly, was
a code sample that showed developers how to use the Pub/Sub client library in
a certain way.</p>

<p>All code at Google goes through a process called “code review”, where code
changes (or additions, deletions) get “proposed” and reviewed by colleagues,
who either Yea, Nay, or ask for changes. Code review is a fairly common practice
in software engineering, though the implementation varies a lot by company. At
most companies, code review usually something like 30 minutes to 2 days per code
change. Code reviews at most companies are typically fairly high-level, and tend
to concern themselves with broad design or nit-picky things like code style.</p>

<p>That first change I proposed took something like <em>two weeks</em> to get through
code review. I learned more about Go and code design during that code review
than I’d experienced the entire past year leading up to that point (which is
not that high of a bar, if you know my prior experiences, but still). It was
brutal. My code was picked apart; it was analyzed line-by-line, and then
block-by-block, and then file-by-file. It wasn’t malicious, though: code review
comments were statements of fact, or impartial queries, rather than jabs and
one-ups. They were, “This can be more performant like so: |example|. And,
here’s why: |reason|.”, not “This is terrible. Do it this way: |example|.”.</p>

<p>After years of stagnation in my career at that point it was so wonderful to
be learning again, from people with a deep wealth of knowledge and
experience. I was hooked.</p>

<p>The next year was a lot of this. I got better by inches: by treating each code
review as a learning opportunity; by diving into problems I had no business
being in; by pushing myself, over, and over, and over, to become better.</p>

<p>Looking back, I was getting better: the scope of problems continually increased;
the code reviews went from weeks to hours or days, from everything-under-the-sun
is wrong to fairly-subtle suggestions. I was slowly transitioning from a student
that needed hand-holding, and didn’t provide much in return, to a colleague that
accepted and gave equally (or, closer to equal).</p>

<h1 id="metre-by-unhealthy-metre">
<a class="anchor" href="#metre-by-unhealthy-metre" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Metre by unhealthy metre</h1>

<p>My intense passion for interesting problems and self-improvement finally had an
outlet, and that outlet was unbounded in scope. Worse: it rewarded the effort
I put in: despite my increasing weariness, the scope of my work constantly
increased (by my own volition); my personal reviews were stellar; and my
projects were almost universally a success.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize until fairly late that I was slowly grinding myself down to the
bone. I was working 10, 12, or 14 hour days, and often would work on weekends.
I took my frustrations and problems home rather than leaving them at work; they
were compounded with my increasing dislike of California.</p>

<p>I ended up getting most of the way through that first year before realizing some
things were very bad. For the first time in my life, I recognized signs of
depression. Some combination of a too-intense work schedule, longing for my
old friends and outdoor-focused lifestyle in Colorado, and relationship problems
were causing me to be deeply unhappy.</p>

<p>I won’t get into that part too much. The long story short is that I had a bit of
a break down and decided I needed to move back to Colorado, Google or no Google.
Thankfully, my department was and is fantastic and thoroughly supported me, and
offered me my job at the Colorado campus with a standard cost-of-living pay reduction.</p>

<p>I moved back to Colorado in early 2018 with the same job.</p>

<h1 id="on-to-the-other-side">
<a class="anchor" href="#on-to-the-other-side" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On to the other side</h1>

<p>The year taught me a lot about my limits to an extent that’s hard to put into
words. I’ve learned how to spot signs of too much stress, healthy coping
mechanisms, and how to set boundaries. I’ve learned a lot about what I value,
and the type of life I want for myself. And, it’s helped me refine the kind of
person I want to be: hard-working and respected in my career, yes, but also a kind
friend with space in my life to help others; a well-rounded individual with lots
of time spent outdoors; a good partner. It’s hard not to wish I had had these
skills going into the job. It would have saved a lot of hardship for myself and
my relationship at the time. I suppose the best you can do is try to learn from
hardship, though, and try to become better for it.</p>

<p>In the last year I’ve committed myself to a healthy balance of passion for my
job and all the rest that matter to me: loving relationships with friends and
family; spending time in nature; sports and exercise; hobbies like reading and
taking french lessons; and progressing my “adult” life with things like buying
a house and building a local community.</p>

<p>My work hasn’t suffered hardly as much as I thought it would. Working 7 to
8 hours a day has made me be a lot more efficient with my time: I cancel or
decline a lot more meetings; I don’t take hour-long lunches with colleagues;
I don’t do a lot of after-work events; I delegate a lot more rather than
“superhero” all the work myself. And, the reprecussions never came: my lessened
throughput was celebrated by my manager and team as mental health successes,
rather than the disappointment I was subconsiously bracing myself for.</p>

<p>The outcome is a much healthier, happier day-to-day, week-to-week. I once
again find self-value in things outside of work; I have a robust and healthy
support system of friends and family; I progress myself in sports and hobbies
so that stalls or failures at work are diminished in impact by successes
elsewhere.</p>

<h1 id="keeping-perspective">
<a class="anchor" href="#keeping-perspective" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keeping perspective</h1>

<p>I’ve had the privilege and honour of working with incredible minds, who have
universally been kind and willing to teach. I’ve sat in rooms with people that
have invented entire languages, network protocols, and algorithms for systems
at scale. I’ve had my opinions heard and sincerely considered by these people,
and had the opportunity to learn from them. I’ve had the opportunity to lead;
to design; to mentor; and to teach. I’ve accomplished and learned more (in my
own eyes) in these two years than my entire career before this.</p>

<p>I’ve also had the honour of having incredible managers and directors. I have
felt since day one that I was a valued member of a team; that my opinions held
weight; that I was supported in whatever I decided was best for myself, even if
that meant leaving the company or my team.</p>

<p>I work on things that I find really, really cool: building a performance
benchmarking pipelines and improving client library performance; defining the
client-side retry strategy for all of Google Cloud; improving Google Cloud
reliability with throttling and load shedding; building important and complex
features into libraries; working on the HTTP/2 transport in gRPC; and loads
more. Moreover, I’ve been given a lot of freedom in choosing the kinds of things
I work on, and being encouraged to go find new problems that we’re not aware of
yet.</p>

<p>I’ve had opportunities to travel around the world, meeting developers, working
with amazing engineers, and giving talks on technical topics. And at home, we
are given a tremendous amount of benefits, too: classes, food,
classes about making food (seriously), gyms, fun events, clubs, and more.</p>

<p>It’s a good place to work. It’s an intense place to work, and you have to be
very careful not to let it burn you up, but it is a good place to work. I
don’t see myself working anywhere else for the foreseeable future.</p>
